Vehicle Fuel Economy Analysis

Overview
This repository contains the code and dataset for analyzing vehicle fuel economy. The analysis explores factors influencing fuel efficiency, such as engine size, fuel type, and transmission type. Insights derived from the analysis can inform consumers, policymakers, and the automotive industry about trends and considerations related to vehicle fuel economy.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle. It includes information about various vehicle attributes, such as engine displacement, fuel type, city and highway MPG, and emissions data.

Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summary statistics and visualizations are used to explore the distribution of fuel economy metrics and investigate relationships between different variables.
Correlation analysis helps identify factors that are strongly associated with fuel efficiency.

Statistical Analysis
Hypothesis testing and regression analysis are performed to assess the significance of relationships between fuel economy and other variables.
Insights from the analysis are interpreted to derive meaningful conclusions about factors affecting fuel efficiency.

Machine Learning (Optional)
A simple linear regression model is trained to predict fuel economy based on engine displacement.
Model performance metrics, such as mean squared error and R-squared, are evaluated to assess predictive accuracy.

Interpretation and Insights
Factors affecting fuel efficiency, such as engine size and fuel type, are identified and discussed.
Implications for consumers, policymakers, and the automotive industry are considered, along with limitations and assumptions of the analysis.

Documentation and Reporting
The analysis process, including data preprocessing steps, analysis methods, and key findings, is thoroughly documented.
Visualizations, code snippets, and interpretations are included to support the analysis and conclusions.
